In this project, a pre-trained Single Shot MultiBox Detection model is implemented to perform object detection on videos! 
To download the model, please follow this link as the file is too large to upload on github: The purpose of this project is to show how to use OpenCV, Face Cascades, and your webcam to create a simple Face Detection program
